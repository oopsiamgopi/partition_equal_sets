# Partitioning problem:
Arbitrary list of integers of any length and in any order. Determine if the list is partitionable or not. A partitioned list is one where it can be split into 2 lists with equal sum. Enumerate the list of cases to solve to minimize execution time and provide the Order of the algorithm

# Technics Used:
- Recursion
- Backtrack
- Time Complexity O(2^n)
